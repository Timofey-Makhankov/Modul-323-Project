1. list - Display all current tasks
   - Description: This command lists all the tasks currently stored in the task manager.
   - Example usage:
     > list
   - Possible issues:
     - If there are no tasks yet, it will display nothing. You can add tasks using the `add [name]` command.
     - If the task list fails to display, check if the database is properly connected and ensure there are no issues with the data.

2. add [title] - Add a new task
   - Description: This command adds a new task to the task manager with the specified name.
   - Example usage:
     > add Finish homework
   - Additionally you can give the following optional information:
        - Description
        -  Category ID
        - Parent task ID
        - Deadline
   - This will create a task with the title "Finish homework".
   - Possible issues:
     - Make sure the task name is provided. If you leave the name empty, you will see an error.
     - If the task name contains special characters or spaces, make sure it is enclosed in quotation marks: `add "Finish the project"`.

3. read [title] - Read a single task and show subtasks
   - Description: This command allows you to view a specific task and its subtasks.
   - Example usage:
     > read "Finish homework"
   - This will display the task with ID 1 and list any associated subtasks beneath it.
   - Possible issues:
     - Ensure the task name exists. If you provide an invalid or non-existing task name, it will show an error.
     - If the task has no subtasks, the output will state that there are no subtasks.
     - If the task name is correct but the subtasks are missing or not showing, check the database for any data inconsistencies or missing subtask entries.

4. update [title] - Update an existing task
   - Description: Use this command to update an existing task.
   - Example usage:
     > update 1 "Complete homework"
   - This will change the task with name 1 to have the title "Complete homework".
   - Possible issues:
     - Make sure the task name exists. If you provide an invalid or non-existing task name, it will show an error.
     - Ensure the new task name is not empty.

5. delete [title] - Delete a task by name
   - Description: This command deletes the task with the specified name from the task list.
   - Example usage:
     > delete 1
   - This will delete the task with name 1 from the task list.
   - Possible issues:
     - Make sure the task name exists. If you provide an invalid name, you will receive an error message.
     - Deleting tasks is permanent. Be sure you want to remove a task before using this command.

6. search [title] - Search for tasks by title
   - Description: This command allows you to search for tasks that contain the specified title (case insensitive).
   - Example usage:
     > search Homework
   - This will search for tasks that have "Homework" in the title and display the matching tasks.
   - Possible issues:
     - Make sure the title is spelled correctly. If no tasks are found, the output will indicate that no matching tasks were found.
     - If you want to search for tasks with a more specific title, provide more specific keywords.
     - The search is case insensitive, so "homework" and "Homework" will yield the same results.

   - Example usage:
     > exit
   - This will terminate the program.
